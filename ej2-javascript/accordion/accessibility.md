# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Accordion control

The Accordion control has been designed keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) specifications, by applying the prompt WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with the keyboard support. Thus, making it usable for people who use assistive WAI-ARIA Accessibility supports that is achieved through the attributes like `aria-labelledby`. It helps to provides information about the elements in a document for assistive technology. The control implements the keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and tested in major screen readers.

The accessibility compliance for the Accordion control is outlined below.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Accordion control accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Accordion control is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/accordion.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Accordion control with accessibility tools.
