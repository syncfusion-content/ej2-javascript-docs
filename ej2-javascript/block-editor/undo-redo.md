# Undo redo in ##Platform_Name## Block Editor control

The undo/redo feature in Block Editor enables users to revert or reapply changes made to the content, offering a safety net for edits and enhancing the overall editing experience.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Windows | Mac | Description |
|------------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Undo       | Ctrl + Z     | ⌘ + Z   | Reverts the last action. |
| Redo       | Ctrl + Y     | ⌘ + Y | Reapplies the last undone action. |

## Configuring Undo/Redo stack

Block Editor allows up to `30` Undo/Redo actions by default. You can modify the number of undo/redo steps using the [undoRedoStack](../api/blockeditor/#undoRedoStack) property.
