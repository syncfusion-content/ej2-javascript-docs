# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Carousel control

The [JavaScript Carousel](https://www.syncfusion.com/javascript-ui-controls/js-carousel) control has been designed, keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-roledescription`, `aria-label`, `aria-current`, `aria-live`, `aria-role` and `aria-hidden`. It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology. The control implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and has been tested in major screen readers.

The accessibility compliance for the Carousel control is outlined below.

## ARIA attributes

The Carousel control is designed by considering [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/) standard. Carousel is supported with ARIA Accessibility which is accessible by on-screen readers and other assistive technology devices. The following list of attributes is added to the Carousel.

| **Roles and Attributes** | **Functionalities**                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| aria-roledescription   | The role description attribute has been added for the root element (carousel) and each carousel slide item (slide).                            |
| aria-label             | Previous, next and play/pause buttons and all indicator elements.                                                                               |
| aria-current           | For the active item indicator element, `aria-current` is set to `true`.                                                                         |
| aria-hidden            | For all carousel elements except the currently visible item, `aria-hidden` is set to `true`.                                                    |
| aria-live              | For carousel items element, when `autoPlay` is `true`, `aria-live` is set to `off`; when `autoPlay` is `false`, `aria-live` is set to `polite`. |
| aria-role              | For carousel slide item, `aria-role` has been grouped.                                                                                           |

## Keyboard interaction

All Carousel actions can be controlled using keyboard keys through the [`allowKeyboardInteraction`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/carousel/#allowkeyboardinteraction) property, which is enabled by default. If you wish to disable the default keyboard interactions, you can set this property to `false`. This is particularly useful if the carousel contains input elements, as pressing the arrow keys might cause the carousel to move unexpectedly. By disabling keyboard interaction, the carousel remains static, allowing the user to focus on the input fields without any interruptions.

This control implements keyboard navigation support by following WAI-ARIA practices. Once focused on the active Carousel element, you can use the following key combinations to interact with the Carousel.

| Key                | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Alt + J</kbd> | Keys to focus the Carousel control (done at application end). |
| <kbd>Arrows</kbd>  | Keys to navigate between slides.                                |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>    | To navigate to the first slide.                                 |
| <kbd>End</kbd>     | To navigate to the last slide.                                  |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>   | To play/pause the slide transitions.                            |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>   | To perform the respective action on its focus.                  |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>     | To Move focus through the interactive elements.                 |
| <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> | To Move focus through the interactive elements.             |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Carousel control accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Carousel control is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/carousel.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Carousel control with accessibility tools.
