# Load on-demand in ##Platform_Name## Chat UI control

You can use the `loadOnDemand` property to load messages dynamically when the scroll reaches the top of the message list improving performance and reducing load times, particularly in long conversations. This ensures a smooth user experience by only fetching messages as needed rather than loading the entire conversation at once.
