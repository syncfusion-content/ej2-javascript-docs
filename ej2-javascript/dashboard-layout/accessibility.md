## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Dashboard Layout control followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Dashboard Layout control:

| **Attributes** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| `role=list` | Indicates the role as a list for the Dashboard Layout element. |
| `role=listitem` | Indicates the role as a listitem for the Dashboard panels. |
| `role=presentation` | Indicates the role as a presentation for the table when the [`showGridLines`](../api/dashboard-layout/#showgridlines) property is enabled. |
| `aria-grabbed` | When the panel is chosen for dragging, the aria-grabbed attribute is set to "true". If it's set to "false", the element can be grabbed for drag-and-drop, but it won't be actively held. |

## Keyboard interaction
