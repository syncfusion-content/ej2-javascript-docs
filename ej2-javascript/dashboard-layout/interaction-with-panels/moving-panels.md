# Moving panels in ##Platform_Name## Dashboard Layout control

Panels can be moved programmatically in the Dashboard Layout in addition to drag-and-drop. Use the DashboardLayout instance method [`movePanel`](../../api/dashboard-layout#movepanel) as shown below:

  ```js
   movePanel(id, row, col)
  ```

Where,
* [`id`](../../api/dashboard-layout/panelModel#id) - ID of the panel which needs to be moved.
* [`row`](../../api/dashboard-layout/panelModel#row) - New row position for moving the panel.
* [`col`](../../api/dashboard-layout/panelModel#col) - New column position for moving the panel.

Each time a panel's position is changed(programmatically or through UI interaction), the Dashboard Layout's [`change`](../../api/dashboard-layout#change) event is triggered.

The following sample demonstrates moving a panel programmatically to a new position in the Dashboard Layout's [`created`](../../api/dashboard-layout#created) event.
