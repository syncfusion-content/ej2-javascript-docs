# Advanced scenarios in ##Platform_Name## DataManager

## Offline Mode

Offline mode in Syncfusionâ€™s ##Platform_Name## DataManager enables full client-side data processing by fetching data from the server once and then performing all subsequent operations (such as filtering, sorting, paging, and grouping) locally, without additional network requests.

This feature is ideal for:

* Applications with static or infrequently changing datasets.

* Reducing repeated server calls to enhance performance.

* Supporting offline first workflows where a persistent internet connection is not guaranteed.

You can enable this feature by setting the `offline` property to **true** when creating the DataManager instance. When the `offline` property is set to **true**, the DataManager fetches data from the server once and then performs all subsequent operations on the locally stored data, ensuring faster and responsive UI interactions without further server round-trips.

In remote data binding, each call to [executeQuery](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/data/dataManager/#executequery) sends a request to the server for processing; to avoid repeated server postbacks, you can set the DataManager to load all data during initialization and handle query processing entirely on the client-side. 

The following sample demonstrates how to enable `offline` mode:

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs1/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/data/advanced-cs1" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/data/advanced-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

## Load On Demand

Load on demand is an efficient technique that optimizes performance and reduces bandwidth usage by fetching only a specific subset of data from the server, rather than loading the entire dataset at once. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications dealing with large datasets, ensuring faster load times and improved responsiveness.

You can achieve load on demand using the [Query.page](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/data/query/#page) method in Syncfusion's ##Platform_Name## DataManager. This method requests a specific page of data from the server, based on the given page number and page size.

For example, an employee directory in an HR portal displays thousands of records. Instead of loading all employees at once, the Grid uses `Query.page` to retrieve only the records for the current page, loading data on demand as users navigate through pages.

The following code example demonstrates the implementation of load on demand using **DataManager**:

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs2/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/data/advanced-cs2" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs2/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/data/advanced-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/data/advanced-cs2" %}
{% endif %}
