# BPMN Gateway in ##Platform_Name## Diagram

## Gateway

Gateway is used to control the flow of a process and it is represented as a diamond shape. To create a gateway, the shape property of the node should be set as [`gateway`](../../api/diagram/bpmnGateways) and the gateway property can be set with any of the appropriate gateways. The following code example illustrates how to create a BPMN Gateway.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/bpmnShapes-cs3/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/bpmnShapes-cs3/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/bpmnShapes-cs3" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/bpmnShapes-cs3/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/bpmnShapes-cs3/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/bpmnShapes-cs3" %}
{% endif %}

N> By default, the `gateway` will be set as **none**.

There are several types of gateways as tabulated:
