# Commands in ##Platform_Name## Diagram control

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->

The commands in diagram control are used to perform various interactions within the diagram when called. Several commands are available in the diagram, as follows:

* Alignment commands
* Distribute commands
* Sizing commands
* Clipboard commands
* Grouping commands
* Z-order commands
* Zoom commands
* Nudge commands
* FitToPage commands
* Undo/Redo commands

## Align commands

The alignment command enables you to align selected or defined objects, such as nodes and connectors, with respect to the selection boundary or the first selected object. The [`align`](../api/diagram/#align) method parameters are explained below.

### Alignment Options

The [`Alignment Options`](../api/diagram/alignmentOptions/) defines the alignment position of objects to be aligned.

|Alignment|Description|
|----|----|
|Left| Aligns all the selected objects at the left of the selection boundary|
|Right| Aligns all the selected objects at the right of the selection boundary|
|Center| Aligns all the selected objects at the center of the selection boundary|
|Top| Aligns all the selected objects at the top of the selection boundary|
|Bottom| Aligns all the selected objects at the bottom of the selection boundary|
|Middle| Aligns all the selected objects at the middle of the selection boundary|

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

### Objects 

Defines the objects to be aligned. This is an optional parameter. By default, all the nodes and connectors in the selected region of the diagram gets aligned.

### Alignment Mode

[`Alignment Mode`](../api/diagram/alignmentMode/) defines the specific mode, with respect to which the objects to be aligned. This is an optional parameter. The default alignment mode is `Object`. The accepted values of the argument "alignment mode" are as follows.

The below table shows the alignment as `Left` for different alignment modes.

|Nodes before alignment|Alignment mode|Description|Output image|
|----|----|----|----|
|![Align original](images/alignOrginal.png)|Object (Default)|Aligns the objects based on the bounds of first object in the selected list.|![Align Object](images/alignObject.png)|
|![Align original](images/alignOrginal.png)|Selector|Aligns the objects based on the selection boundary.|![Align Selector](images/alignSelector.png)|


The following code example illustrates how to align all the selected objects at the left side of the selection boundary.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs13/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs13/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs13" %}

## Distribute commands

The [`distribute`](../api/diagram/#distribute) method enable you to place the selected objects on the page at equal intervals from each other. The selected objects are equally spaced within the selection boundary. The [`distribute`](../api/diagram/#distribute) method parameters are explained below.

### Distribute options

The factors for distributing shapes using [DistributeOptions](../api/diagram/distributeOptions/) are listed as follows:

|Distribute option| Description|
|----|----|
| RightToLeft | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the right and left sides of the adjacent objects. |
| Left | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the left sides of the adjacent objects. |
| Right | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the right sides of the adjacent objects. |
| Center | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the center of the adjacent objects. |
| BottomToTop | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the bottom and top sides of the adjacent objects. |
| Top | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the top sides of the adjacent objects. |
| Bottom | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the bottom sides of the adjacent objects. |
| Middle | Distributes the objects based on the distance between the vertical center of the adjacent objects. |

### Objects 

Defines the objects to be distributed. This is an optional parameter. By default, all the nodes and connectors in the selected region of the diagram gets distributed.

The following code example illustrates how the nodes are distributed using the `RightToLeft` option.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs14/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs14/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs14" %}

![Distribute Sample](images/Commands_img2.png)

## Sizing commands

The [`sameSize`](../api/diagram/#samesize) command enables you to size all selected nodes to match the size of the first selected object or the first node in the objects collection you provide as the second parameter. The parameters for the [`sameSize`](../api/diagram/#samesize) method are explained below.

### Sizing options

[`SizingOptions`](../api/diagram/sizingOptions) include:

|Sizing options|Description|
|----|----|
| Width | Adjusts the width of all objects to match the width of the first node in the objects collection. |
| Height | Adjusts the height of all objects to match the height of the first node in the objects collection. |
| Size | Adjusts both the width and height of all objects to match the size of the first node in the objects collection. |

### Objects

This optional parameter defines which objects should be scaled. By default, all nodes and connectors within the selected region of the diagram are scaled.

The following code example illustrates how to execute the size commands.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs15/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs15/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs15" %}


![Sizing Sample](images/Commands_img3.png)

## Clipboard commands

Clipboard commands are used to cut, copy, or paste selected elements in the diagram using the [`cut`](../api/diagram/#cut), [`copy`](../api/diagram/#copy), [`paste`](../api/diagram/#paste) methods. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for these actions. For detailed information on using these methods refer the below table.

| Command (Shortcut key) | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Cut` (CTRL+X)  | Removes the selected elements from the diagram and places them onto the diagram’s clipboard. This operation is performed using the [`cut`](../api/diagram/#cut)  method. |
| `Copy`(CTRL+C)  | Duplicates the selected elements and places them onto the diagram’s clipboard without removing them from their original location. Use the [`copy`](../api/diagram/#copy) method for this operation. |
| `Paste`(CTRL+V) | Inserts the elements stored on the diagram’s clipboard (nodes and connectors) into the diagram. This can be done using the [`paste`](../api/diagram/#paste) method. |

The [`paste`](../api/diagram/#paste) method optionally accepts a collection of nodes or connectors to be added to the diagram.

The following code illustrates how to execute the clipboard commands.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs1" %}

## Grouping commands

Grouping Commands are used to group or ungroup selected elements in the diagram. Grouping commands help in managing and organizing multiple elements by combining them into a single group or separating them into individual elements. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for these actions. The following table provides more details on these commands:

| Commands (Shortcut key) | Description|
|----|----|
| [`Group`](../api/diagram/#group) (CTRL+G) | Combines the selected nodes and connectors into a single group, allowing you to move, resize, or apply other operations to all grouped elements as a unit. |
| [`Ungroup`](../api/diagram/#ungroup) (CTRL+Shift+U) | Splits a previously grouped set of nodes and connectors into individual elements, enabling you to modify or manipulate them separately.            |

The following code examples demonstrate how to use the grouping commands in diagram:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs2/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs2" %}

## Rotate commands

The [`rotate`](../api/diagram/#rotate) commands in the diagram allow users to rotate selected elements by specified angles. These commands are useful for adjusting the rotate angle of nodes or shapes within the diagram.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| obj | NodeModel / ConnectorModel/ SelectorModel | The objects to be rotated. |
| angle | number | The angle by which the objects should be rotated (in degrees). |
| pivot (optional)   | PointModel| The reference point with respect to which the objects will be rotated. |
| rotateUsingHandle (optional) | boolean | Whether to rotate using the handle. |

You can also use CTRL+R to rotate clockwise and CTRL+L to rotate anti-clockwise. The following example shows how to rotate nodes in clockwise and anti-clockwise direction.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs19/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs19/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs19" %}


## Z-Order command

**Z-Order commands** allow you to control the stacking order of selected objects, such as nodes and connectors, on the diagram page.

### Bring to front command

The [`bringToFront`](../api/diagram/#bringtofront) command moves the selected element to the front, placing it above all other elements in the diagram. The following code illustrates how to use the `bringToFront` command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs3/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs3/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs3" %}

### Send to back command

The [`sendToBack`](../api/diagram/#sendtoback) command moves the selected element to the back, placing it behind all other elements in the diagram. The following code illustrates how to use the `sendToBack` command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs4/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs4/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs4" %}

### Move forward command

The [`moveForward`](../api/diagram/#moveforward) command moves the selected element one step forward in the stack, placing it above the nearest overlapping element. The following code illustrates how to use the `moveForward` command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs5/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs5" %}

### send backward command

The [`sendBackward`](../api/diagram/#sendbackward) command moves the selected element one step backward in the stack, placing it behind the underlying element. The following code illustrates how to use the `sendBackward` command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs6/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs6/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs6" %}


The Z-order commands can also be performed using keyboard shortcuts. For more information, refer to the [`keyboard commands`](./interaction/#keyboard).

## Zoom

The [`zoom`](../api/diagram/#zoom) command is used to zoom-in and zoom-out the diagram view.

The following code illustrates how to zoom-in the diagram.

```javascript
import {
    Diagram
} from '@syncfusion/ej2-diagrams';
//Initializes the diagram component
var diagram = new ej.diagrams.Diagram({
    width: '100%',
    height: '350px',
});
diagram.appendTo('#element');
// parameter 1 - Sets the zoomFactor
// parameter 2 - Defines the focusPoint to zoom the diagram with respect to any point
//When you do not set focus point, zooming is performed with reference to the center of current diagram view.
diagram.zoom(1.2, {
    x: 100,
    y: 100
});
```

For more information about zoom refer to the [zoom](./scroll-settings/#update-zoom-at-runtime)

## Nudge command

The [`nudge`](../api/diagram/#nudge) command moves the selected elements up, down, left, or right by 1 pixel. The parameters of [`nudge`](../api/diagram/#nudge) method is explained below.

| Parameter    | Type           | Description                                                      |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| direction    |[`NudgeDirection`](../api/diagram/nudgeDirection/) | Defines the direction in which the objects should be moved.      |
| x (optional) | number         | The horizontal distance by which the selected objects should be moved. |
| y (optional) | number         | The vertical distance by which the selected objects should be moved.   |
| type (optional) | string      | A string that defines the type of nudge action.                           |

The accepted values for the "direction" argument are as follows:

* Up: Moves the selected elements up by the specified delta value.
* Down: Moves the selected elements down by the specified delta value.
* Left: Moves the selected elements left by the specified delta value.
* Right: Moves the selected elements right by the specified delta value.

The following code illustrates how to execute the nudge command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs7/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs7/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs7" %}

### Nudge by using arrow keys

The arrow keys can be used to move the selected elements up, down, left, or right by 1 pixel.

![Nudge Command](images/Commands_img4.png)

Nudge commands are particularly useful for accurate placement of elements.

N> The position change event will not trigger when using keyboard keys to move a node or connector.

## BringIntoView

The [`bringIntoView`](../api/diagram/#bringintoview) command brings the specified rectangular region into the viewport of the diagram, ensuring that it is visible within the current view.

The [`bringIntoView`](../api/diagram/#bringintoview) method takes a single parameter, an object that defines the rectangular region to bring into view. This object should include properties such as x, y, width, and height to specify the exact region to be made visible.

The following code illustrates how to execute the bringIntoView command:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs8/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs8/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs8" %}

## BringToCenter

The [`bringToCenter`](../api/diagram/#bringtocenter) command centers the specified rectangular region of the diagram content within the viewport.

The [`bringToCenter`](../api/diagram/#bringtocenter)  method takes a single parameter, an object that defines the rectangular region to be centered. This object should include properties such as x, y, width, and height to specify the exact region to be brought to the center.

The following code illustrates how to execute the bringToCenter command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs9/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs9/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs9" %}

## FitToPage

The [`fitToPage`](../api/diagram/#fittopage) command adjusts the diagram content to fit within the viewport, considering either width, height, or the entire content. The fitToPage method takes one parameter, [`fitOptions`](api/diagram/iFitOptions/), which specifies the options for fitting the diagram to the page.

### FitOptions

The [`mode`](../api/diagram/fitModes/) parameter defines how the diagram should fit into the viewport—horizontally, vertically, or based on the entire bounds of the diagram.

The [`region`](../api/diagram/diagramRegions/) parameter specifies the region of the diagram that should be fit within viewport.

The [`margin`](../api/diagram/marginModel/) parameter sets the margin around the diagram content that should be included in the view.

The [`canZoomIn`](../api/diagram/iFitOptions/#canzoomin) parameter enables or disables zooming in to fit smaller content into a larger viewport.

The [`canZoomOut`](../api/diagram/iFitOptions/#canzoomout) parameter enables or disables zooming out to fit larger content into a smaller viewport.

The [`customBounds`](../api/diagram/iFitOptions/#custombounds) parameter defines a custom region that should be fit into the viewport.

The following code illustrates how to execute `FitToPage` command.


{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs10/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs10/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs10" %}

## Command manager

The Diagram provides support for mapping or binding command execution to specific key gestures. It includes built-in commands and allows for the definition of custom commands through the [`commandManager`](../api/diagram/commandManagerModel/). Custom commands are executed when the specified key gesture is recognized.

### Custom Command

To define a custom command, you need to specify the following properties:

* [`execute`](../api/diagram/commandModel/#execute): A method to be executed when the command is triggered.
* [`canExecute`](../api/diagram/commandModel/#canexecute): A method that determines whether the command can be executed at a given moment.
* [`gesture`](../api/diagram/keyGestureModel/): A combination of [`keys`](../api/diagram/keys/) and [`KeyModifiers`](../api/diagram/keyModifiers/) that defines the key gesture for the command.
* [`parameter`](../api/diagram/commandModel/#parameter): Any additional parameters required at runtime for the command.
* [`name`](../api/diagram/commandModel/#name): The name of the command.

To explore the properties of custom commands, refer to [`Commands`](../api/diagram/commandModel/).

The following code example illustrates how to use the command manager to clone a node and change the fill color of a node while pressing `G` and `Shift+G` or `Alt+G`, respectively:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs17/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs17/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs17" %}

### Disable/Modify the existing command

When any of the default commands are not desired, they can be disabled. Additionally, if you need to change the functionality of a specific command, it can be completely modified.

The following code example illustrates how to disable the default cut and delete commands using CTRL+X and Delete keys, and how to modify the copy command to clone a node using CTRL+C:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs18/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs18/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/commands-cs18" %}

## Undo-redo

Undo/redo commands can be executed through shortcut keys. Shortcut key for undo is **`Ctrl+z`** and shortcut key for redo is **`Ctrl+y`**. For more information refer to the [`undo-redo`](./undo-redo)
