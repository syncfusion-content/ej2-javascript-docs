# Text wrapping style in ##Platform_Name## Document editor control

Text wrapping refers to how images and shapes are fit with surrounding text in a document. Currently, DocumentEditor has only preservation support for image and textbox shape with below wrapping styles.

## In-Line with Text

In this option, the image or shape is placed on the same line surrounding with text like any other word or letter. This image or shape will be automatically moved along with the text while editing, whereas the other options denote that the image or shape stays in a fixed position while the text shifts and wraps around it.

## In Front of Text

In this option, the image or shape is placed in front of the text. This can be used to place an image around some text or to add shape to highlight the part in a paragraph.

## Top and Bottom

>Note: Starting from v19.1.0.x, the top and bottom wrapping style is supported.
