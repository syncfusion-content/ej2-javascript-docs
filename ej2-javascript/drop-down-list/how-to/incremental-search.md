# Incremental search in ##Platform_Name## Drop down list control

DropDownList supports incremental search, by default. You can search the list item by focusing the DropDownList and typing the characters in it. The closely matched items are selected sequentially.

> If the same key is searched once again, the next matched item is selected.
