# Aggregates in ##Platform_Name## Grid control

Aggregate values are displayed in the footer, group footer, or group caption of the Grid. It can be configured through `aggregates` property.
[`Field`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn/#field) and [`type`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn/#type) are the minimum properties required to represent an aggregate column.

To use the aggregate feature, you have to inject the `Aggregate` module.

By default, the aggregate value can be displayed in the footer, group, and caption cells. To show the aggregate value in one of the cells, use the [`footerTemplate`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn/#footertemplate), [`groupFooterTemplate`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn#groupfootertemplate), or [`groupCaptionTemplate`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn/#groupcaptiontemplate) property.

## Built-in aggregate types

The aggregate type should be specified in the [`type`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn/#type) property to configure an aggregate column.

The built-in aggregates are,
* Sum
* Average
* Min
* Max
* Count
* Truecount
* Falsecount

> * Multiple aggregates can be used for an aggregate column by setting the [`type`](../../api/grid/aggregateColumn/#type) property
with an array of aggregate types.
> * Multiple types for a column is supported only when one of the aggregate templates is used.
