# Searching in ##Platform_Name## Grid control

The Syncfusion ##Platform_Name## Grid includes a powerful built-in searching feature that allows users to search for specific data within the grid. This feature enables efficient filtering of grid records based on user-defined search criteria, making it easier to locate and display relevant information. Whether you have a large dataset or simply need to find specific records quickly, the search feature provides a convenient solution.

To use the searching feature, need to inject  **Search** module in the grid and set the [allowSearching](../../api/grid/column/#allowsearching) property to **true** to enable the searching feature in the grid.

To further enhance the search functionality, you can integrate a search text box directly into the grid's toolbar. This allows users to enter search criteria conveniently within the grid interface. To add the search item to the grid's toolbar, use the [toolbar](../../api/grid/#toolbar) property and add **Search** item.

> The clear icon is shown in the Data Grid search text box when it is focused on search text or after typing the single character in the search text box. A single click of the clear icon clears the text in the search box as well as the search results in the Grid.

## Initial search

By default, the search operation can be performed on the grid data after the grid renders. However, there might be scenarios where need to perform a search operation on the grid data during the initial rendering of the grid. In such cases, you can make use of the initial search feature provided by the grid.

To apply search at initial rendering, need to set the following properties in the [searchSettings](../../api/grid/#searchsettings) object.

Property |Description
--------|-----
**fields** |Specifies the [fields](../../api/grid/searchSettingsModel/#fields) in which the search operation needs to be performed.
**operator** |Specifies the [operator](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#operator) to be used for the search operation.
**key** |Specifies the [key](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#key) value to be searched.
**ignoreCase** |[ignoreCase](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#ignoreaccent) specifies whether the search operation needs to be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
**ignoreAccent** |[ignoreAccent](../../api/grid/searchSettingsModel/#ignoreaccent) property will ignore the diacritic characters or accents in the text during a search operation.

The following example demonstrates how to set an initial search in the grid using the `searchSettings` property. The `searchSettings` property is set with the following values:

1. `fields`: **CustomerID** specifies that the search should be performed only in the 'CustomerID' field.
2. `operator`: **contains** indicates that the search should find records that contain the specified search key.
3. `key`: **Ha** is the initial search key that will be applied when the grid is rendered.
4. `ignoreCase`: **true** makes the search case-insensitive.
5. `ignoreAccent`: **true** will ignores diacritic characters or accents during the search operation.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/grid-cs156" %}
{% endif %}

> By default, grid searches all the bound column values. However, you can customize this behavior by definining the [searchSettings->fields](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#fields) property.

## Search operators

Search operators are symbols or keywords used to define the type of comparison or condition applied during a search operation. They help specify how the search key should match the data being searched. The [searchSettings->operator](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#operator) property can be used to define the search operator in the grid. 

By default, the `searchSettings->operator` is set to **contains**, which returns the values contains the search key. The following operators are supported in searching:

Operator |Description
-----|-----
startswith |Checks whether a value begins with the specified value.
endswith |Checks whether a value ends with the specified value.
contains |Checks whether a value contains with the specified value.
wildcard |Processes one or more search patterns using the **"*"** symbol, returning values that match the given patterns.
like |Processes a single search pattern using the **"%"** symbol, retrieving values that match the specified pattern.
equal |Checks whether a value equal to the specified value.
notequal |Checks whether a value not equal to the specified value.

These operators provide flexibility in defining the search behavior and allow you to perform different types of comparisons based on your requirements.

The following example demonstrates how to set the `searchSettings->operator` property based on changing the dropdown value using the [change](../../api/drop-down-list/#change) event of the [DropDownList](../../drop-down-list/getting-started) control.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/search-operator-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

## Search by external button

The Syncfusion Grid control allows you to perform searches programmatically, enabling you to search for records using an external button instead of relying solely on the built-in search bar. This feature provides flexibility and allows for custom search implementations within your application. To search for records using an external button, you can utilize the [search](../../api/grid/#search) method provided by the Grid control.

The `search` method allows you to perform a search operation based on a search key or criteria. The following example demonstatres how to implement `search` by an external button using the following steps:

1. Add a button element outside of the grid control.
2. Attach a click event handler to the button.
3. Inside the event handler, get the reference of the grid control.
4. Invoke the `search` method of the grid by passing the search key as a parameter.

{% include code-snippet/grid/search-method-cs1/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/search-method-cs1" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/search-method-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/search-method-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/search-method-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

## Search specific columns

By default, the [search](../../api/grid/#search) functionality searches all visible columns. However, if you want to `search` only specific columns, you can define the specific column's field names in the [searchSettings->fields](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#fields) property. This allows you to narrow down the search to a targeted set of columns, which is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or grids with numerous columns.

The following example demonstrates how to search specific columns such as **CustomerID**, **Freight**, and **ShipCity** by using the `searchSettings->fields` property.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs1/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs1" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

## Search on each key stroke

The search on each keystroke feature in Syncfusion Grid enables you to perform real-time searching of grid data as they type in the search text box. This functionality provides a seamless and interactive searching experience, allowing you to see the search results dynamically updating in real time as they enter each keystroke in the search box

To achieve this, you need to bind the `keyup` event to the search input element inside the [created](../../api/grid/#created) event of the grid control. 

In the following example, the `created` event is bound to the grid control, and inside the event handler, the `keyup` event is bound to the [search](../../api/grid/#search) input element. Whenever the `keyup` event is triggered, the current `search` string is obtained from the `search` input element, and the `search` method is invoked on the grid instance with the current search string as a parameter. This allows the search results to be displayed in real-time as you type in the search box.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs2/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs2" %}
{% endif %}

> Search on each key stroke approach may affect the performance of the application when dealing with a large number of records.

## Perform search based on column formatting

By default, the search operation considers the underlying raw data of each cell for searching. However, in some cases, you may want to search based on the formatted data visible to the users. To search data based on column formatting, you can utilize the `grid.valueFormatterService.fromView` method within the [actionBegin](../../api/grid/#actionbegin) event. This method allows you to retrieve the formatted value of a cell and perform searching on each column using the **OR** predicate.

The following example demonstrates how to implement searching based on column formatting in the Grid. In the `actionBegin` event, retrieve the search value from the [getColumns](../../api/grid/#getcolumns) method. Iterate through the columns and check whether the column has a format specified. If the column has a format specified, use the `grid.valueFormatterService.fromView` method to get the formatted value of the cell. If the formatted value matches the search value, set the **OR** predicate that includes the current column filter and the new filter based on the formatted value.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/search-formatting-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

## Perform search operation in Grid using multiple keywords

In addition to searching with a single keyword, the Grid control offers the capability to perform a search operation using multiple keywords. This feature enables you to narrow down your search results by simultaneously matching multiple keywords. It can be particularly useful when you need to find records that meet multiple search conditions simultaneously. This can be achieved by the [actionBegin](../../api/grid/#actionbegin) event of the Grid.

The following example demonstrates, how to perform a search with multiple keywords in the grid by using the `query` property when the `requestType` is searching in the `actionBegin` event. The searchString is divided into multiple keywords using a comma (,) as the delimiter. Each keyword is then utilized to create a `predicate` that checks for a match in the desired columns. If multiple keywords are present, the predicates are combined using an **OR** condition. Finally, the Grid's `query` property is updated with the constructed `predicate`, and the Grid is refreshed to update the changes in the UI.

On the other hand, the [actionComplete](../../api/grid/#actioncomplete) event is used to manage the completion of the `search` operation. It ensures that the search input value is updated if necessary and clears the `query` when the search input is empty.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/column-search-cs4" %}
{% endif %}

> By using this approach, you can perform a search operation in the grid using multiple keywords.

## How to ignore accent while searching

By default, the searching operation in the Grid control does not ignore diacritic characters or accents. However, there are cases where ignoring diacritic characters becomes necessary. This feature enhances the search experience by enabling data searching without considering accents, ensuring a more comprehensive and accurate search  and it can be achieved by utilizing the [searchSettings->ignoreAccent](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#ignoreaccent) property of the Grid control as **true**.

The following example demonstrates how to define the `ignoreAccent` property within the [searchSettings](../../api/grid/#searchsettings) property of the grid. Additionally, the [EJ2 Toggle Switch Button](../../switch/getting-started) control is included to modify the value of the `searchSettings->ignoreAccent` property. When the switch is toggled, the [change](../../api/switch/#change) event is triggered, and the `searchSettings->ignoreAccent` property is updated accordingly. This functionality helps to visualize the impact of the `searchSettings->ignoreAccent` setting when performing search operations.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/search-ignoreAccent-cs1/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/search-ignoreAccent-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/search-ignoreAccent-cs1" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/search-ignoreAccent-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/search-ignoreAccent-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/search-ignoreAccent-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

> * You can set [searchSettings->ignoreAccent](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#ignoreaccent) property along with other search settings such as [fields](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#fields), [operator](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#operator), and [ignoreCase](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#ignoreaccent) to achieve the desired search behavior.
> * This feature works only for the characters that are not in the ASCII range.
> * This feature may have a slight impact on search performance.

## Highlight the search text

The Syncfusion Grid control allows you to visually highlight search results within the displayed data. This feature helps you to quickly identify where the search items are found within the displayed data. By adding a style to the matched text, you can quickly identify where the search items are present in the grid.

To achieve search text highlighting in the Grid, you can utilize the [queryCellInfo](../../api/grid/#querycellinfo) event. This event is triggered for each cell during the Grid rendering process, allowing you to customize the cell content based on your requirements.

The following example demonstrates how to highlight search text in grid using the `queryCellInfo` event. The `queryCellInfo` event checks if the current cell is in the desired search column, retrieves the cell value, search keyword and uses the `includes` method to check if the cell value contains the search keyword. If it does, the matched text is replaced with the same text wrapped in a `span` tag with a `customcss` class. You can then use CSS to define the `customcss` class and style to easily identify where the search keywords are present in the grid.

## Clear search by external button

The Syncfusion Grid control provides a capability to clear searched data in the grid. This functionality offers the ability to reset or clear any active search filters that have been applied to the grid's data.

To clear the searched grid records from an external button, you can set the [searchSettings->key](../../api/grid/searchSettings/#key) property to an `empty` string to clear the search text. This property represents the current search text in the search box.

The following example demonstrates how to clear the searched records using an external button.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/clear-search-cs1/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/clear-search-cs1/index.html %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/clear-search-cs1" %}
{% endif %}

> You can also clear the searched records by using the clear icon within the search input field.
