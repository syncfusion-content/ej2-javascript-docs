The ListBox component displays a list of items from which the user can select one or more items. The other supported features are data binding, drag and drop, grouping, sorting and templating.

## Key features

* [`Grouping`](sorting-and-grouping#grouping) -  Supports grouping of logically related items under a single or specific category.

* [`Templates`](icons-and-templates#templates) - Allows to customize each list of items contained in the list box.

* [`Sorting`](sorting-and-grouping#sorting) - Supports sorting of list items in an alphabetical order (either ascending or descending).

* [`Drag and drop`](drag-and-drop) - Allows to drag and drop within the list box or between the two list boxes.

* [`Accessibility`](accessibility) - Provided with built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the DropDownList component features through the keyboard, screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
