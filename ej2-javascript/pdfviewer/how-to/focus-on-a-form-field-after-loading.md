# Focus on a form field after loading in ##Platform_Name## Pdfviewer control

The PDF Viewer library allows you to focus to the respective form field using the `focusFormField()` API.

The following steps are used to focus to the respective form field.

**Step 1:** Follow the steps provided in the [link](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/pdfviewer/getting-started/) to create a simple PDF Viewer sample.

**Step 2:** Use the following code sample to focus to the respective form field while loading as well as in a button click.

```
  <button id="focusFormField">FocusFormField</button>
```

```ts
//Event triggers while clicking the FocusFormField button.
document.getElementById('click').addEventListener('click', function () {
    var formField = viewer.retrieveFormFields();
    //API to bring the form fields in focus.
    viewer.focusFormField(formField[1]);
});
//Event triggers while loading the document.
viewer.documentLoad = (args) => {
    var formField = viewer.retrieveFormFields();
    //API to bring the form fields in focus.
    viewer.focusFormField(formField[1]);
};
```
