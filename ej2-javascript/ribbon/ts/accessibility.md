# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Ribbon control

The Ribbon control followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Ribbon control is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Ribbon control followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Ribbon control:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=tablist` | Used to identify the element that serves as the container for a set of tabs. |
| `role=tab` | Indicates an interactive element within a tablist that, when activated, displays its associated tab panel.|
| `role=tabpanel` | Specifies the role for the content associated with an active tab, describing its role in presenting the active content.|
| `role=button` | Represents a clickable element that trigger a response when activated by the user.|
| `role=menu` | Represents an item that have sub menu.|
| `role=menuitem` | Indicates an option in a set of choices within a menu. |
| `role=combobox` | Identifies an element as an input that controls another element, commonly used for dropdowns. |
| `role=option` | Used for selectable items in a combobox. |
| `role=gridcell` | Specified as gridcell for the tiles in the color palette. |
| `aria-orientation` | Indicates the element's orientation as horizontal, vertical, or unknown/ambiguous. |
| `aria-selected` | Indicates the current `selected` state of various widgets. |
| `aria-labelledby` | Sets to the Tab content element to indicates the associated Tab header for the content. |
| `aria-controls` | Indicates the associated tabpanel for the header by setting the attribute on Tab items. |
| `aria-haspopup` | Indicates availability and type of interactive popup triggered by the element it's set on. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, making it not editable or operable. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates whether a control is expanded or collapsed, set on the respective element. |
| `aria-label` | Defines a string value that labels an interactive element for accessibility. |
| `aria-checked` |  Indicates the current `checked` state of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other widgets. |
| `aria-owns` | Identifies an element or elements, establishing a relationship when DOM hierarchy can't represent it. |
| `aria-readonly` |  Indicates that the element is not editable but is otherwise operable. |
| `aria-activedescendent` | Identifies the currently active element when focus is on a combobox, textbox, group, or application. |
| `aria-autocomplete` |  Indicates whether inputting text could trigger display of predictions and specifies how predictions will be presented for a combobox, searchbox, or textbox. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Ribbon control followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Ribbon control.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Ribbon control's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Ribbon control is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/ribbon.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Ribbon control with accessibility tools.
