# Localization in ##Platform_Name## Scheduler control

The Scheduler supports different date-time formats and cultures, enabling it to function globally and meet the diverse needs of various regions.

You can adapt the Scheduler to different languages by parsing and formatting dates and numbers ([`Internationalization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/common/internationalization)), and by adding culture-specific customization and translation for text ([`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/common/localization)).

## Globalization

The Internationalization library provides support for formatting and parsing numbers, dates, and times using official [`Unicode CLDR`](http://cldr.unicode.org/) JSON data. It also provides the `loadCldr` method to load culture-specific CLDR JSON data.

By default, the Scheduler follows English culture ('en-US'). To use a different culture, follow these steps:

* Install the `CLDR-Data` package using the following command (this installs CLDR JSON data):

  ```
  npm install cldr-data --save
  ```

  Once installed, you can find culture-specific JSON data under `/node_modules/cldr-data`.

* Import the required culture files from the installed location into your `app.ts` or script file:

    1. numberingSystems.json
    2. ca-gregorian.json
    3. numbers.json
    4. timeZoneNames.json

* Set the culture for the Scheduler using the `locale` property.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs1" %}

## Localizing static Scheduler text

The [`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/common/localization) library allows you to display all static text, date content, and time mode of the Scheduler in a localized language. To achieve this, set the `locale` property of the Scheduler and define translation text for static words through the `load` method.

For example, the following code defines French translations for all static words used in the Scheduler:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs2/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs2" %}

The localized words for static text used in the Scheduler and Recurrence Editor can be found in the following code. Access static text for all cultures from the [`Syncfusion locale repository`](https://github.com/syncfusion/ej2-locale).

## Setting date format

The Scheduler supports all valid date formats and uses the universal format "MM/dd/yyyy" by default. If the [`dateFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/schedule#dateformat) property is not specified, the Scheduler will use the format based on the assigned locale. Since the default locale is "en-US", it follows the "MM/dd/yyyy" pattern automatically.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs3/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs3/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs3" %}

## Setting time format

Time formats control how time values are displayed as strings in the Scheduler. By default, the Scheduler's time mode is either 12-hour or 24-hour format based on the [`locale`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#locale) setting. Since the default locale value is "en-US", the time mode is automatically set to 12-hour format. You can customize this using the [`timeFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#timeformat) property. For more information about time format standards, refer to the [`Date and Time Format`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/internationalization#custom-formats) section.

The following example demonstrates the Scheduler control in 24-hour format:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs4/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs4/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs4" %}

> Note: The `timeFormat` property only accepts valid time format strings.

## Displaying Scheduler in RTL mode

The Scheduler layout and behavior can be changed to follow RTL (Right-to-Left) conventions by setting [`enableRtl`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#enablertl) to `true`. This displays the Scheduler layout from right to left. The default value is `false`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs5/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs5/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/localization-cs5" %}
