# Selection in ##Platform_Name## Spreadsheet control

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

Selection provides interactive support to highlight the cell, row, or column that you select. Selection can be done through Mouse, Touch, or Keyboard interaction. To enable selection, set `mode` as `Single` | `Multiple` in [`selectionSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#selectionsettings). If you set `mode` to `None`, it disables the UI selection.

{% endif %}

**User Interface**:

* Click on a cell to select it (or) use the `arrow` keys to navigate to it and select it.
* To select a range, select a cell, then use the left mouse button to select and drag over to other cells (or) use the `Shift + arrow` keys to select the range.
* To select non-adjacent cells and cell ranges, hold `Ctrl` and select the cells.

You can quickly locate and select specific cells or ranges by entering their names or cell references in the Name box, which is located to the left of the formula bar, and also select named or unnamed cells or ranges by using the Go To (`Ctrl+G`) command.

## Row selection

Row selection is used to select a single or multiple rows.

**User Interface**:

You can perform row selection in any of the following ways,

* By clicking the row header.
* To select multiple rows, select a row header with the left mouse button and drag over to other row headers (or) use the `Shift + arrow` keys to select multiple rows.
* To select non-adjacent rows, hold `Ctrl` and select the row header.
* You can also use the `selectRange` method for row selection.

The following sample shows the row selection in the spreadsheet, here selecting the 5th row using the `selectRange` method.

{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs1/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs1" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs1/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs2/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs2" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs2/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selection-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Get selected cell values

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

You can select single or multiple cells, rows, or columns using mouse and keyboard interactions. You can also programmatically perform selections using the [selectRange](https://helpej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#selectrange) method. This selection behavior is controlled by the [selectionSettings](https://helpej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#selectionsettings) property. Finally, you can retrieve the selected cell values as a collection using the [getData](https://helpej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#getdata) method.

Below is a code example demonstrating how to retrieve the selected cell values as a collection programmatically:

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selected-cell-values/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selected-cell-values/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/selected-cell-values" %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "javascript" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.js" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selected-cell-values/index.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/selected-cell-values/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/selected-cell-values" %}
{% endif %}
