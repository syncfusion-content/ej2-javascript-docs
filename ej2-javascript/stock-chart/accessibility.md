# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Stock chart control

Accessibility is achieved in the stock chart control through WAI-ARIA standard. The stock chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the stock chart:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Element</b></td>
<td><b>Default description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Title</td>
<td>Reads the stock chart's title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legend</td>
<td>Reads the series name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Series Points</td>
<td>Reads the Point x :  Point y value</td>
</tr>
</table>
