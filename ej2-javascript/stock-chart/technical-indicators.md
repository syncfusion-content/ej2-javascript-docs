# Technical indicators in ##Platform_Name## Stock chart control

A technical indicator is a mathematical calculation based on historic price, volume or open interest information that aims to forecast financial market direction.

StockChart supports 10 types of technical indicators namely `Accumulation Distribution`, `ATR`, `EMA`,`SMA`,`TMA`,`Momentum`,`MACD`,`RSI`,`Stochastic`,`Bollinger Band`. By using indicator dropdown box you can add an remove the required indicators types.

## Accumulation Distribution

Accumulation Distribution combines price and volume to show how money may be flowing into or out of stock. To render a Accumulation Distribution Indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `AccumulationDistribution` and inject
`AccumulationDistributionIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(AccumulationDistributionIndicator)`. To calculate the signal line [`volume`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#volume) field is additionally added with `dataSource`.

## Average True Range (ATR)

ATR measures the stock volatility by comparing the current value with the previous value. To render a Average True Range (ATR) Indicator,
use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Atr` and inject `AtrIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(AtrIndicator)`.

## Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

Moving average Indicators are used to define the direction of the trend. To render a EMA Indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Ema` and inject `EmaIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(EmaIndicator)`.

## Momentum

Momentum shows the speed at which the price of the stock is changing. To render a Momentum indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Momentum`and inject `MomentumIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(MomentumIndicator)` method. Momentum indicator will be represented by two lines (upperLine, signalLine).In momentum indicator the upperBand value is always renders at the value 100.

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

MACD is based on the difference between two EMA's. To render a MACD Indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Macd` and inject `MacdIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(MacdIndicator)`.MACD indicator will be represented by MACD line,signal line, MACD histogram. MACD histogram is used to differentiate MACD line and signal line.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI shows how strongly a stock is moving in its current direction. To render a RSI Indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Rsi` and inject `RsiIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(Rsindicator)`.RSI indicator will be represented
by three lines (upperBand, lowerBand, signalLine). The upperBand and lowerBand values are customized by [`overBought`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#overbought) and [`overSold`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#oversold) properties of indicator and the signalLine is calculated by RSI formula.

## Simple Moving Average (SMA)

Moving average Indicators are used to define the direction of the trend. To render a SMA Indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Sma` and inject `SmaIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(SmaIndicator)`.

## Stochastic

It shows how a stock is, when compared to previous state. To render a Stochastic indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Stochastic` and inject `StochasticIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(StochasticIndicator)` method.
stochastic indicator will be represented by four lines (upperLine, lowerLine, periodLine, signalLine). In stochastic indicator the upperBand value and lowerBand value is customized by [`overBought`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#overbought) and [`overSold`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#oversold) properties of indicators and the periodLine and signalLine is render based on stochastic formula.

## Triangular Moving Average (TMA)

Moving average Indicators are used to define the direction of the trend. To render a TMA Indicator, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `Tma` and inject `TmaIndicator` module using `StockChart.Inject(TmaIndicator)`.

## Bollinger Band

A StockChart overlay that shows the upper and lower limits of normal price movements based on the standard deviation of prices. To render a Bollinger Band, use indicator [`type`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#type) as `BollingerBand` and inject `BollingerBands` module using `StockChart.Inject(BollingerBands)` method. Bollinger band will be represented by three lines (upperLine, lowerLine, signalLine).
The default values of the Bollinger Band [`period`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#period) is 14 and [`standardDeviations`](../api/stock-chart/stockChartIndicator/#standarddeviation) is 2.
