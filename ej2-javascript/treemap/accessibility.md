# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## TreeMap control

The TreeMap control follows commonly used accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles).

The accessibility compliance for the TreeMap control is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The TreeMap control follows the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the TreeMap control:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=region` | It specifies the TreeMap areas that do not support interactive functions like selection and highlight. |
| `role=button` | It specifies the TreeMap areas where interactive functions such as selection and highlight are available. |
| `aria-label`  | Provides an accessible name for the title, subtitle, data labels, legend title, and legend item labels. |

## Screen reading in TreeMap

Accessibility in the TreeMap control ensures that all users, regardless of ability or disability, can use screen reading. The following TreeMap elements will be read aloud using screen reading software, such as Narrator for Windows.

| Elements | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data labels | Reads the labels displayed on leaf items of the TreeMap. |
| Title | Reads the title in the TreeMap. |
| Subtitle | Reads the title below the main title content in the TreeMap. |
| Legend title | Reads the title of the legend in the TreeMap. |
| Legend item label | Reads the label of the legend item in the TreeMap. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The TreeMap control's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the TreeMap control is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/tree-map.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the TreeMap control with accessibility tools.
