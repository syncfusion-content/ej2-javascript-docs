# Convert image into binary format after uploading in ##Platform_Name## Uploader control

By default, the file upload component saves the uploaded image files in physical directories. Also, you can convert the images into binary format at server-side before saving the uploaded images. To retrieve binary format of image files, convert the posted fileâ€™s input stream into binary reader and read as bytes using ReadBytes method.

Refer to the below server-side code snippet

```c#

[AcceptVerbs("Post")]
public void Save()
{
    try
    {
        if (System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Files.AllKeys.Length > 0)
        {
            var httpPostedFile = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Files["UploadFiles"];

            if (httpPostedFile != null)
            {
                byte[] fileBytes;
                using (BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(httpPostedFile.InputStream))
                {
                    fileBytes = br.ReadBytes((int)httpPostedFile.InputStream.Length);
                    // bytes will be stored in variable fileBytes
                }
                HttpResponse Response = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response;
                Response.Clear();
                Response.ContentType = "application/json; charset=utf-8";
                Response.StatusCode = 200;
                Response.Status = "200 Success";
                Response.End();
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        HttpResponse Response = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response;
        Response.Clear();
        Response.ContentType = "application/json; charset=utf-8";
        Response.StatusCode = 204;
        Response.Status = "204 No Content";
        Response.StatusDescription = e.Message;
        Response.End();
    }
}
