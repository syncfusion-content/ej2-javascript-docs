# Accessibility For Ej2 JavaScript

The web accessibility makes web content and web applications more accessible for people with disabilities. It especially helps in dynamic content change and development of advanced user interface controls with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. Breadcrumb provides built-in compliance with `WAI-ARIA` specifications. The `WAI-ARIA` support is achieved using the attributes such as `aria-label`and `aria-disabled`.
