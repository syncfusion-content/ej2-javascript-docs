# Disable

## Particular button

To disable a particular button in a ButtonGroup, [`disabled`](../../api/button#disabled) attribute should be added to the corresponding button element.

## Whole ButtonGroup

To disable whole ButtonGroup, [`disabled`](../../api/button#disabled) attribute should be added to all the button elements.

The following example illustrates how to disable the particular and the whole ButtonGroup.

{% tab template= "button-group/disable", sourceFiles="index.html,styles.css" %}

{% endtab %}

> To disable radio/checkbox type ButtonGroup, the `disabled` attribute should be added to the particular input element.
