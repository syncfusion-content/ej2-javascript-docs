# Responsive and adaptive layout

The control is provided with built-in responsive support, where panels within the layout get adjusted based on their parent element's dimensions to accommodate any resolution which relieves the burden of building responsive dashboards.

The dashboard layout is designed to automatically adapt with lower resolutions by transforming the entire layout into a stacked one so that the panels will be displayed in a vertical column. By default, whenever the screen resolution meets 600px or lower resolutions this layout transformation occurs. This transformation can be modified for any user defined resolution by defining the for the [`mediaQuery`](../api/dashboard-layout/#mediaquery) property of the component.

The following sample demonstrates the usage of [`mediaQuery`](../api/dashboard-layout/#mediaquery) property to turn out the layout into a stacked one in user defined resolution. Here, whenever, the window size reaches 700px or lesser, the layout becomes a stacked layout.

{% tab template="dashboard-layout/getting-started",sourceFiles="app.ts,index.html,index.css" es5Template="media-query" %}

```typescript
import { DashboardLayout } from '@syncfusion/ej2-layouts';

// initialize dashboardlayout component
let dashboard: DashboardLayout = new DashboardLayout({
    cellSpacing: [20, 20],
    mediaQuery: 'max-width: 700px',
    columns: 5,
    panels: [{ "sizeX": 1, "sizeY": 1, "row": 0, "col": 0, content: '<div class="content">0</div>' },
    { "sizeX": 3, "sizeY": 2, "row": 0, "col": 1, content: '<div class="content">1</div>' },
    { "sizeX": 1, "sizeY": 3, "row": 0, "col": 4, content: '<div class="content">2</div>' },
    { "sizeX": 1, "sizeY": 1, "row": 1, "col": 0, content: '<div class="content">3</div>' },
    { "sizeX": 2, "sizeY": 1, "row": 2, "col": 0, content: '<div class="content">4</div>' },
    { "sizeX": 1, "sizeY": 1, "row": 2, "col": 2, content: '<div class="content">5</div>' },
    { "sizeX": 1, "sizeY": 1, "row": 2, "col": 3, content: '<div class="content">6</div>' }
    ]
});
// render initialized dashboardlayout
dashboard.appendTo('#dashboard_default');
