## Badge types

The types of Essential JS 2 badges are as follows:

* Circle
* Pill
* Link
* Notification
* Overlap
* Dot
* Position

### Circle

The circle badge style can be applied by adding the modifier class `.e-badge-circle` to the target element.

{% tab template="badge/circle", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}

### Pill

The pill badge style can be applied by adding the modifier class `.e-badge-pill` to the target element.

{% tab template="badge/pill", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}

### Link

When badge modifier classes are applied to the anchor tag, the badgeâ€™s appearance will change from normal state to hover state on mouseover.

{% tab template="badge/link", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}

### Notification

The notification badge style can be applied by adding the modifier class `.e-badge-notification` to the target element. Notification badges are used when a content or a context needs special attention. While using the notification badge, set the parent element to `position: relative`.

{% tab template="badge/notification", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}

### Dot

Dot can be applied by adding the modifier class `.e-badge-dot` to the target element. Dot badges are similar to notification badges, but in a minimalistic way. While using the dot badge, set the parent element to `position: relative` .

{% tab template="badge/dot", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}

### Overlap

The overlap badge can be used with `notification` or `dot` badge, which overlaps with the target element by adding the modifier class`.e-badge-overlap`. While using the overlap badge, set the parent element to `position: relative`.

{% tab template="badge/overlap", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}

### Position

The default position of the `notification` or `dot` badge is top. But, the position can be changed to `bottom` using the modifier class `.e-badge-bottom`. For example, the bottom class modifier is used with dot badge to display the status in the avatar as shown in the following sample.

{% tab template="badge/position", isDefaultActive = "true", sourceFiles="index.html", es5Template="basic-template" %}

```typescript

```

{% endtab %}
