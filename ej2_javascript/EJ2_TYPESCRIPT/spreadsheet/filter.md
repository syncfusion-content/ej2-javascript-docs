# Filtering

Filtering helps you to view specific rows in the spreadsheet by hiding the other rows. You can use the [`allowFiltering`](../api/spreadsheet/#allowfiltering) property to enable or disable filtering functionality.

> * The default value for `allowFiltering` property is `true`.

By default, the `Filter` module is injected internally into Spreadsheet to perform filtering.

## Apply filter on UI

In the active sheet, select a range of cells to filter by value of the cell. The filtering can be done by any of the following ways:

* Select the filter item in the Ribbon toolbar.
* Right-click the sheet, select the filter item in the context menu.
* Use the [`applyFilter()`](../api/spreadsheet/#applyfilter) method programmatically.
* Use `Ctrl + Shift + L` keyboard shortcut to apply the filter.

> * Use `Alt + Up/Down` keyboard shortcut to open the filter dialog.

## Filter by criteria

The [`applyFilter()`](../api/spreadsheet/#applyfilter) method will apply the filter UI, based on the predicate and range given in the arguments.

> * The [`beforeFilter`](../api/spreadsheet/#beforefilter) event will be triggered before filtering the specified range.
> * The [`filterComplete`](../api/spreadsheet/#filtercomplete) event will be triggered after the filter action is completed successfully.

The following code example shows `filter` functionality in the Spreadsheet control.

{% tab template="spreadsheet/filter", sourceFiles="app.ts,index.html", es5Template="filter", iframeHeight="450px", isDefaultActive=true %}

```typescript

import { Spreadsheet, ColumnModel } from '@syncfusion/ej2-spreadsheet';
import { tradeData } from './datasource.ts';

let columns: ColumnModel[] = [{ width: 100 }, { width: 130 },{ width: 96},
    { width: 130 }, { width: 130 },{ width: 96},
    { width: 100 }, { width: 100 },{ width: 110}, { width: 100 }, { width: 130 },{ width: 150}]

let spreadsheet: Spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet({
    sheets: [{ ranges: [{ dataSource: tradeData }], columns: columns }],
    allowFiltering: true,
    dataBound: function () {
        if (spreadsheet.activeSheetIndex === 0) {
            let departments: string[] = ['Sweden', 'Canada', 'UK'];
            let predicateList: PredicateModel[] = []
            departments.forEach((department: string) => { predicateList.push({ field: 'D', predicate: 'or', operator: 'equal', value: department }); })
            spreadsheet.applyFilter(predicateList);
        }
    }
});

//Render the initialized Spreadsheet
spreadsheet.appendTo('#spreadsheet');
```

{% endtab %}

## Filter by cell value

To apply a filter for a cell value, right-click the cell and choose filter -> `Filter By Selected Cell's Value` option from the menu. It applies the filter based on the value of the selected cell in the current sheet.

## Clear filter

After applying filter to a certain column, you may want to clear it to make all filtered rows visible again. It can be done in the following ways,

* Choose `Clear` option in ribbon toolbar under `Filter and Sort`. It clears the filters applied in the spreadsheet for all fields.

* Use the [`clearFilter()`](../api/spreadsheet/#clearfilter) method programmatically, to clear the applied filters in spreadsheet for all fields.

## Clear filter on a field

After filtering, you can clear/reset the filter for a field alone. It can be done in the following ways,

* Click filter icon in the columnâ€™s header and then choose `Clear Filter` option from the filter dialog.
* You can right-click on a filtered column cell and choose `Clear Filter from <Column Name>.` option from the context menu.
* Use the [`clearFilter(field)`](../api/spreadsheet/#clearfilter) method programmatically, to clear the filter in a particular column.

## Reapply filter

When you want to reapply the filter after some changes happened in the rows. It can be done in the following ways,

* You can choose `Reapply` option in ribbon toolbar under `Filter and Sort` to reapply the filtered columns again.
* You can right-click on a filtered cell and choose `Reapply` option from the context menu. It reapplies the filters again in the Spreadsheet for all the fields.

## Known error validations

The following errors have been handled for filtering,
* *Out of range validation:* When the selected range is not a used range of the active sheet, it is considered as invalid and the out of range alert with the message `Select a cell or range inside the used range and try again` will be displayed. No filter will be performed if the range is invalid.

## Limitations

The following features have some limitations in Filter:

* Insert/delete row/column between the filter applied cells.
* Merge cells with filter.
* Copy/cut paste the filter applied cells.
