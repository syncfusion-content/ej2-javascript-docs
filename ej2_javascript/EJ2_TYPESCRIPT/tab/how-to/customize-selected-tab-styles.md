# Customize selected tab styles

You can customize the Tab style by overriding its header and active tab CSS classes. Define HTML string for adding animation and customizing the Tab header and pass it to [`text`](../../api/tab/header#text) property. Now you can override the style using custom CSS classes added to the Tab elements.

> You can add the custom class into Tab component using [`cssClass`](../../api/toolbar/item#cssclass) property which is used to customize the Tab component.

{% tab template="tab/active-tab-style", es5Template="es5_active_tab_style", sourceFiles="index.ts,index.html,index.css" %}

```typescript

import {Tab} from '@syncfusion/ej2-navigations';

let tabObj: Tab = new Tab({
    cssClass: "e-tab-custom-class",
    items: [
        {
            header: { 'text': '<div><div class="e-image e-andrew"></div><div class="e-title fade-in">Andrew</div></div>' },
