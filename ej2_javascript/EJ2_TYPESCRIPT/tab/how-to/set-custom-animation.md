# Set custom animation

Tab supports custom animations for both previous and next actions from the provided animation option of `Animation` library. The [`animation`](../../api/tab#animation) property also allows you to set [`easing`](../../api/tab/tabActionSettings#easing), [`duration`](../../api/tab/tabActionSettings#duration), and various other [`effect`](../../api/tab/tabActionSettings#effect).

Default animation is given as `SlideLeftIn` for [`previous`](../../api/tab/tabAnimationSettings#previous) tab animation and `SlideRightIn` for [`next`](../../api/tab/tabAnimationSettings#next) tab animation. You can also disable the animation by setting the animation effect as `None`. Also, please use the following CSS to disable indicator animation for animation effect as `None`.

```CSS

.e-tab .e-tab-header:not(.e-vertical) .e-indicator, .e-tab .e-tab-header.e-vertical .e-indicator {
    transition: none;
}

```

The sample demonstrates some types of animation that suits Tab. You can check all the animation effects here.
