# State Persistence

State persistence refers to the TreeGrid's state maintained in the browser's [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser.
State persistence stores treegrid’s model object in the local storage when the [`enablePersistence`](../api/treegrid/#enablepersistence) is defined as true.

## Get or set localStorage value

If the [`enablePersistence`](../api/treegrid/#enablepersistence) property is set to true, the treegrid property value is saved in the `window.localStorage` for reference. You can get/set the localStorage value by using the `getItem`/`setItem` method in the `window.localStorage`.

```typescript
//get the TreeGrid model.
let value: string = window.localStorage.getItem('treegridTreeGrid'); //"treegridTreeGrid" is component name + component id.
let model: Object = JSON.parse(model);

```

```typescript
//set the TreeGrid model.
window.localStorage.setItem('treegridTreeGrid', JSON.stringify(model)); //"treegridTreeGrid" is component name + component id.

```
